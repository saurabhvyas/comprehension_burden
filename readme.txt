This repo will be updated as I update the code , There is only one ipython file

So far I have implemented a code snippet which takes a section para text as
an input and generates the potential concepts as output

To run 
type ipython notebook and just browser and open this file

Note : 

I am using Microsoft language service api , so you will need to replace the private key , I have changed it for security purposes .
